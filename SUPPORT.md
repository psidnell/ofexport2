# Update 2017-11-06

Sadly I can no longer provide support for this project owing to the demise of my Mac.

I'm happy to leave this here as a resource and merge in any pull requests but I'm no longer in a position to fix bugs or add features etc.

Significantly, [OmniFocus 3](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/) has been announced for Q1 2018 which will almost certainly
break compatibility with ofexport2.
